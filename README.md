What is it?
==========
This library allows to fetch the files for usable components in the kaleo framework using the kaleo configs and url queries to determine the files to fetch based on environments

Installation
============
This libray can be installed using:

 * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) :  `npm install solone --save`
 * [Bower](https://bower.io/) : `bower install solone --save`
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) : `yarn add solone`
 
Getting started
============
The script can be loaded both in the head and in the body. 
All functionality is automatically loaded as soon as the file is loaded.
*Note: include this script before any other scripts for proper implementation* 
```
 <script src="/(node_modules|bower_modules)/solone/init.min.js"></script>
```

To start using it is simple as call the main method with the name of the component which fetches the component using a promise
```
 solone('component')
 .then(console.log) // logs component function
 .catch(console.error) // in case the component does not exist
```

Environment
============
Setting the allowable environments and the current environment help you to seperate out which component versions to fetch

Altering class config
```
solone.config().env = 'qa';
```

Using local config.js
```
module exports = {
  environments: ['qa'],
  env: 'qa'
}
```

Using the header query
```
  /component?env=qa
```

Routing
============
Routing comes in two forms, a NodeJS backend based routing and a frontend based routing.
By default frontend based routing will be on. To turn on backend routing do the following

NodeJS *express/connect
```
httpserver.use(require('solone'));
```

Frontend
```
solone.backendRouting(true);
```

You can also change the directory where your app exists by using the base and prefix settings.
this can be changed either through the library methods or in your config file. What this does is
set the beginning of the url that will be used when fetching your local config, auth, and component files.

Config
```
module.exports = {
  prefix: '/app',
  base: '/src'
}
```

Library
```
solone.base('/src')
.prefix('/app');
```

Authentication
============
Authentication allows for using authorization to allow the fetching of any component.
In this way you can block the use of some components without proper authentication.
Authentication is done in the following files

NodeJS
```
auth-server.js
```

Frontend
```
auth-client.js
```

The authentication method recieves the following:

- Param 1 Info (object) Info on the request
  - component: The name of the component
  - query: A query object containing the environment, debug and other header query info
  - headers: Any headers that were passed, for FE this can be altered in regards what to send to the server, BE this is the sent headers
- Param 2 Resolve (function) run this to dictate authorization was a success
- Param 3 Reject (function) run this to dictate the authorization was a failure

Example: (only allow prod environment)
```
function (info, resolve, reject){
  if(info.query.env === 'prod') return resolve();
  reject();
}
```

A on authorization failed event can also be added for extra functionality
```
solone.setAuthFailListener(function(component, query){
  console.error('You are not an authorized user for this component!', component);
})
```
